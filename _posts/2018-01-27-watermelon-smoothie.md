I chose a watermelon smoothie because it has one of my favorite fruits, and it is the perfect drink for a hot summers day. I have included the ingredients to a good reipie. If you're not interested in this specific recipe, there are plenty more on the internet you could try, or you can make your own!

**Ingredients**
1 1/2 cups (240 g) fresh watermelon, cubed (black seeds removed)
1 cup (120 g) frozen strawberries
1/2 ripe banana (50 g), previously peeled, chopped and frozen
1/2 - 3/4 cup (120-180 ml) unsweetened plain almond milk
1 lime, juiced (~30 ml)
1 Tbsp chia or hemp seeds (optional)
