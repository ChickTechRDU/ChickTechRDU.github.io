Making Chicken Nuggets
--------------------
* 3 skinless, 
* boneless chicken breasts
* 1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
* 1 teaspoon salt
* Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
* Cut chicken breasts into 1 1/2-inch sized pieces. In a medium bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, cheese, salt, thyme and basil. Mix well. Put melted butter in a bowl or dish for dipping.
* Dip chicken pieces into the melted butter first, then coat with the breadcrumb mixture. Place the well-coated chicken pieces on a lightly greased cookie sheet in a single layer, and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
